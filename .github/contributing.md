# Overview
Brief overview of what will covered in the contributing document. [An example contributing document](https://github.com/TangoYankee/spark-database/blob/master/.github/contributing.md)

## Software Tools
Brief oultine (or bullet-point list) to describe the software tools that are being used, such as Python 3.6.5, Flask, Github as a database, Heroku, MapBox JS, and anything else pertinent. Preferably, the name of each tool will also be a link to that software tools homepage.

## Data Workflow
Brief outline of the designed data flow, i.e) WOEIP collects the data, uploads it to our application, we join it, store it on Github, and visualize it with MapBox/JS.
Link to google doc/lucidchart that has chart of workflow

## Wireframe
Brief outline of what the wireframe is and why it is that way. Link to google doc/lucidchart that has wireframes of website

## Project Status
Brief outline as to why there are three repositories, what they are, and how we're currently combining them.

## Workflow
Obnoxiously **Detailed** Instructions on the process to create different version, modify code, create new issues, lynt the code, make pull requests, and launch the production version to Heroku. Include git and python commands using ```formatting for code```. Example from spark-website wiki [git setup](https://github.com/TravisSpark/spark-website/wiki/Local-Setup#steps) and [git sharing and testing](https://github.com/TravisSpark/spark-website/wiki/Local-Setup#share-on-github)

## Local Setup
Slightly-less obnoxious instructions to create a local version of the application to use for development. Include either Ubuntu or Mac ```command line instructions```. Example from [spark-database contributing](https://github.com/TangoYankee/spark-database/blob/master/.github/contributing.md#local-setup)
